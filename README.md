# Hangman

### Hangman Game Instructions

To start the Hangman game, you need to provide a secret phrase as a command line argument. This phrase can consist of multiple words and may contain apostrophes, spaces, and hyphens. Please ensure that your secret phrase does not exceed 256 characters in length.

Upon starting the game, any special characters present in the secret phrase will be displayed, and they will also appear every time the guesses are updated. If the secret phrase consists only of special characters, the player automatically wins.

During gameplay, the player can guess only one letter at a time at the guessing prompt. If the user fails to provide a secret phrase or enters the wrong number of arguments, appropriate error messages will be displayed to guide the player.

Enjoy playing Hangman!
